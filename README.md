# 3Dmodels

In this repository I have some renders of 3D models I made myself in Blender.

I am no expert but I love learning. Over the years I have made better models, faster. I am proud to say that if I have ever needed some 3D object for any project (work presentations mostly), I made my own.

Go ahead and scroll through the folders!

Every model you see have taken me quite a lot of time and effort. That's why I upload just low resolution, water-marked renders.
I am happy to discuss the sharing of high resolution images or even the 3D objects themselves. Please write to me if you are interested!
