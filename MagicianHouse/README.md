## Magician House
I started this project after reading the Black Magician Chronicles, by Trudi Canavan. I've always had a taste for magic and these books absorbed me completely.

Without spoilers, I'll say that I was captivated by the High Lord and I imagined several times how his misterious house would be. How it would look in the distance, against the sunset.

Obviously the logical thing to do was to model the house myself and have a walk around. The original idea was to use it for a small escape-room style game. But I was doing a PhD. Who has time for more?

The game never happened. But the house was pretty much all done and the texturing proccess was starting.

I am open to finish texturing and putting all together for actual use!

What do you think of black magic?
